# 2D Ray Tracing Convolution Reverb in Csound

The scope of the project is to implement a 2D ray tracing algorithm in Csound to model a room
in 2D and create an impulse response function table which can then be convoluted with the
incoming audio signal to achieve the desired reverberation. The project is limited to 2D because
the primary goal of this project is to establish the concept of ray tracing in Csound so that it
can be a base for future developments in 3D. The mathematical implementation of 2D ray tracing is
based on simple linear algebra concepts.
The write up gives an in-depth explanation of the algorithm and the implementation of the
algorithm in Csound.
